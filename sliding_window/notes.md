# Sliding Window

Manipulates data structures with contiguous sequence of elements that can be iterated over such as strings, arrays, and linked lists. Variants contain fixed or dynamic lengths.

Usually involves finding minimum, maximum, longest, shortest, or presence of element(s) in the linear data structure.

**Fixed variants**: constrained to a fixed size k

**Dynamic variant**: either sum is greater than or equal to a value, or using an auxiliary data structure for longest sequence.
